# Project: Address Book App Written in React

## CSC 47300 Spring 2019: HW 4 Task 5

> An address book where entries can be added and deleted.
> To delete, the trash icon must be pressed twice.
> Entries can be searched for using the search box.

> Minor Bugs:
> - 1 - When adding new entries, sometimes the new entry is duplicated in the list. However after using the search box to search for anything the duplicate disappears.
> - 2 - When clearing the search box the delete key may have to be pressed an extra time for all entries to appear again.
> - 3 - When using the search box, the space key may have to be pressed after your query so that the complete search results appear.
